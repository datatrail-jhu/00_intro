# Welcome!
Hi there! Welcome! You're about to start working through an introductory course called "Introduction to Chromebook Data Science." In this course you will learn how to use a Chromebook, get a bunch of necessary accounts set up, and work your way through your first data science project. If you aren't quite sure what that means yet, don't worry! We will walk you through each step and explain things along the way! 

# Let's Get Started! 
First things first, a Chromebook is the laptop-looking machine in front of you. Chromebooks are similar to laptops, but have fewer bells and whistles. But, a Chromebook is the only piece of equipment you will need to work through everything in this course and to carry out data science projects. To get started, complete the following steps:

1. Open the Chromebook like you would a normal laptop.
2. Once open, the Chromebook will turn on and a screen will appear. If that screen says 'Welcome', follow all the the following steps. If it instead has someone else's name (or many other people's names) in the middle of the screen, skip to step 7. 
3. In the bottom right-hand of the screen you will see a blue "Let's go" button.  **Click on the 'Let's go' button.**
4. A 'Connect to network' screen will pop up. **Click on ADD APPROPRIATE NETWORK HERE.** Great! You are now connected to the Internet!
5. The next screen includes 'Google Chrome OS terms'. After scrolling to read through these, **click 'Aceept and continue'** (the blue button at the bottom right).
6. A 'Sign in to your Chromebook' screen is next. *Do not enter any information here yet.* 
7. At the bottom left-hand of the screen, you will see 'Browse as Guest'. **Click on 'Browse as Guest.'**
8. A Google Chrome browser window will pop up. In the middle of this it will say, 'You're browsing as a Guest.' You're now ready to get started!
  
# Getting a Leanpub account!
Before getting into the course, you'll first need a Leanpub account. To get this:

1.  **Type 'leanpub.com' into the web address bar** at the top of the browser and then **hit 'enter' on the keyboard.**
2. This will bring you to Leanpub's webpage. The first thing you will do here is **click the black 'Sign up' button** in the top right-hand of the screen.
3. To get a leanpub account you will need to **provide your Name and Email in the blank boxes**. 
4. You will also need to **come up with a username**. A combination of your first and last name is a good usernmame. For example, if your name is Jane Doe, your username could be JaneDoe.
5. Then, **decide on a Password and enter it in the provided box**.
6. Next, **click on the empty box next to "I'm not a robot"** to state that you are not a robot.
7. Finally **click the blue 'Create Account' button.**

#### Congrats! You are now logged on, have a Leanpub account, and are ready to get started with the first part of this course!
