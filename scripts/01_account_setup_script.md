Before we can get started doing fun things with data we need to make sure you are set up to use all of the different accounts that you will need throughout the course. 

We will tell you briefly what each of these accounts is used for and how to set it up now. If you don't know what each of these accounts is for exactly, don't worry! We will walk you through everything you need to know.

Choosing an appropriate username is important. Some combination of your first and last name is a good idea. For example, if your name were Jane Doe, a username such as JaneDoe, all as one word with a capital "J"" and a capital "D" would work. If the first username you attempt is taken, you can try another, similar username. In this case, maybe try Jane underscore Doe. 

But, be sure that whatever name you choose, you would be comfortable sharing it with your boss or family member. Usernames with nicknames or profanity are not a good idea.

In the next two lessons, we will get you set up with not only a Google account, but also accounts with Linked In, Twitter, slack, r studio cloud, data camp and github. We'll explain what each of these is used for and get you all set up. These will all be used throughout the program and are regularly used by data scientists.
