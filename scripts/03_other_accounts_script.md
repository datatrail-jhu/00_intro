Other Accounts Setup

Linked In is a social networking site for employment. Think of it as Facebook for getting a job. It allows you to put your qualifications online, sort of like an online resum. It also has a space where you can look for jobs and puts you in contact with employers. Don't worry about the details now. Through this program, you will have the chance to set up your LinkedIn gradually. For right now, we're just worried about getting this account set up. 

To begin set up, you'll go to the web address bar in your Chrome browser. 

You will type w w w linked in dot com and hit Enter. This will bring you to Linked In's login screen. 

On this screen you'll begin filling out the boxes in the middle of the screen. Be sure to use the Gmail username you just created in the last chapter when asked for your Email address. Choose a password that cannot be easily guessed by somoene else. 

Once the four boxes are filled in, click Join now.

A screen may pop up asking you to verify that you are not a robot. Whenever this happens, just click on the empty square box to let the computer know you're a real person.

After clicking Join now and maybe after you verify that you are a human, you will be brought to a new screen. 

Here, at the top, it will show you that you almost have a Linked In login but that first you have to confirm your email address.

To do so, you will open a new tab at the top of the Chrome browser window. 

You will then type in w w w w dot gmail dot com and click Enter. This will bring you to your email account. 

An email from Linked In Messages should be there. Click on that email to open it.

In that email, there will be a button where you can click to Confirm your email. 

This will open a new screen where your google username will be in the box already. Click Continue on this screen. 

While other boxes may pop up for you to go further on LinkedIn and get your profile set up, this is all you have to do for now. You now have a LinkedIn username and account! We will now go through similar processes for the other accounts needed in this program.

The second account you will need will be a Twitter account. You may already be familiar with Twitter; however, data scientists tend to use Twitter for work rather than socializing. Twitter is a social media platform where users can post and interact with messages. These messages are known as tweets. Twitter is a great place to learn new things, connect with other data scientists, and to ask/answer questions quickly.

To get a Twitter account, first type w w w dot twitter dot com in the search bar at the top of your Chrome session. 

This will bring you to a screen where at the top right you'll want to click Sign up. 

This will bring you to a screen that prompts you for some information and asks you to create a new password. After filling out the information, you will click Sign up.

You will be brought to a screen asking for your phone number. After entering your phone number, you will click Next. 

This will bring you to a screen where you will chosse a username. This will be what your Twitter handle will be. For simplicity, it would be best for your Gmail username and Twitter handle to be the same. If that username is unavailable, choose a different, but appropriate and simple, Twtitter username. Once you have chosen a Twitter username, click Next.

At this point you will be brought to a screen that will have a button saying Let's go! If you were to click this, it would lead you to set up your profile further, which is not needed at this time. 

Instead, go to your gmail, look for an email from Twitter and click on the email. 

In this email, there will be a Confirm now button to click. To verify your Twitter account, click on this button. 

Congrats! You now have a Twitter account!

Slack is a place where teams of people can easily communicate and work together on a project. As a data scientist, you are often working in a group on a project. Slack is a place where everyone working on that project can communicate. Slack is where communication throughout this course will happen. You will be able to ask questions, answer questions, and communicate with others on Slack about the things you are learning and the projects you are working on.

To get a slack account, you will first type w w w dot slack dot com. On this webpage, type your Gmail address in the email address box, and click GET STARTED.

As a data scientist A LOT of your work will be done in something called R Studio. In this program, you will be learning the basics of the programming language, R. R is a free programming language for statistical computing and graphics. In other words, the code you write to work with data will all be done in R. R Studio is the place where you will type this code and make basic plots.

Luckily, r studio cloud makes it easy to sign up. You will first go to r studio dot cloud. Note that this web address does not start with w w w.

This will bring you to a screen where you can click on Get Started.

This will bring you to a login screen where, instead of typing in your information, since you already have a Google account, just click on Sign up with Google. 

You will be prompted to choose which Google account you want to use. Choose your professional Google account. 

Then, you will be brought to a screen where you will have to enter a username. Again, for simplicity, try to use the same username across all accounts. Then, click Create Account and you're all set! 

You now have an r studio cloud account!

Data Camp is an online platform where people learn Data Science. Throughout this program, you will take courses and do exercises on DataCamp to ensure that you are acquiring the skills necessary to be a successful data scientist.

Getting a Data Camp account will be very similar to getting an r studio cloud account because you can again sign in using your Google account. To do so, go to w w w dot data camp dot com. You will be brought to a screen where you can Create Your Free Acount. Click on the Google plus button. 

You will again be brought to a screen where you're asked to choose your Google account. Select your Google account. 

And, just like that, you have a DataCamp account! 

GitHub is a website that hosts computer code and allows for version control. We'll get back to what version control is later, but as for now, know that GitHub is where you'll be putting all of the code you write. It's also a place where you can look at other people's code. And, throughout this program, you'll realize that you can learn a lot from other people's code!

To get a GitHub account, first type www.github.com into the web address bar at the top of your Chrome window and hit Enter. 

You will be brought to a page where you should fill in your information. As with the other accounts, try to use the same Username if possible. Enter your Gmail Email address. And, create a password that cannot be easily guessed by others. Then, click 'Sign up for GitHub.'

You now have a GitHub account and all of the online accounts needed for this program!
