# Google Sheets

Google Sheets is a free, online spreadsheet program. If you're familiar with Excel, it is similar to Excel. If you are unfamiliar with Excel, that's ok! We'll go through everything you need to know to get started on the project here. And, later in the program, we will go into more details to get you fully comfortable working with Google Sheets. As for right now, just know that when you have data that you want to input into a spreadsheet, Google Sheets is an ok place to start. Google Sheets is great because you never have to worry about saving your work. If you are online, Google Sheets automatically saves your work.

### What is a spreadsheet?

A spreadsheet is a type of document where data are stored in rows and columns of a grid. Each square is referred to as a 'cell' in teh spreadsheet In Google Sheets (and many other spreadsheet programs), the rows are numbered (i.e. 1,2,3) and the columns are specified by capital letters (i.e. A, B, C). 

This way you can refer to any specific spot in the grid. For example, A2 specifies the data in cell in the first column (A) and second row of the spreadsheet. 

For this first project you will collect data and enter it into a Google Sheet. We'll discuss the details of how to do this now.
