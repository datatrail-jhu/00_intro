# DataCamp

DataCamp is a website for learning about the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). We will be using DataCamp because: 

* DataCamp allows you to practice R without having to set up all the software
* DataCamp has courses covering a broad range of topics we are going to cover in the courses 

### Logging on to DataCamp

You previously signed on to DataCamp in an earlier lesson and you will simply repeat that process now by first going to 'www.datacamp.com' and clicking the 'Google+' logo to log on.

From here you will be prompted to choose a Google account.

![Google Account Sign in](images/10_datacamp/10_cdsintro_datacamp-2.png)

You will then be on the DataCamp home page. On this page, you will click on 'Learn' from the menu across the top.

![DataCamp Learn](images/10_datacamp/10_cdsintro_datacamp-3.png)

This will open a drop-down menu. From this menu, you will select 'Introduction to R' from the Course listings on the left-most column.

### Introduction to R

This will bring you to the course page for 'Introduction to R.' Here you will click 'Start Course For Free.'

This will open up the DataCamp course. This layout will be used throughout the course and should look somewhat familiar. It is similar to RStudio Cloud in that you have a place where you will write your code (SCRIPT.R) and a place where that code will run (R CONSOLE). However, DataCamp is different in that it has lessons and exercises to help teach you how to code in the programming language R. 

The information you need to learn will always be on the left side of the DataCamp window. At the top there will be an 'EXERCISE.' The text in here will explain what you need to know to complete the lesson.

![DataCamp Exercise](images/10_datacamp/10_cdsintro_datacamp-6.png)

Below the 'EXERCISE' is the 'INSTRUCTIONS' section. This window will include the specific instructions for what you will need to do before continuing on to the next part of the course.

![DataCamp Instructions](images/10_datacamp/10_cdsintro_datacamp-7.png)

If you scroll through this part of the window, you will notice a 'Take Hint' button that you can click on. You'll always want to try the exercise without taking a hint; however, if you get stuck, clicking on 'Take Hint' may help you.

Now that you know where to find instructions, you're ready to start learning how to code. All code will be written in the SCRIPT.R portion of the DataCamp window in the top right-hand portion of the screen.

The code you write will then execute, or be carried out in the R CONSOLE in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen. 

![DataCamp R Console](images/10_datacamp/10_cdsintro_datacamp-10.png)

In order to run a line of code, you can first highlight the line you want to run. You then click on 'Run Code.' This will send the code to the console to execute. In this example, you will see that R acts as a calculator. When you run the code '3 + 4' in the R Console, you get back that the answer is '7.'

Once you've completed the task asked of you in the instructions section and clicked 'Run Code' to test your answer, you can then click 'Submit Answer.'

![DataCamp Submit Answer](images/10_datacamp/10_cdsintro_datacamp-12.png)

If your response is correct the screen at left will pop up to let you know that you're ready to continue on to the next section of the course. Press 'Enter' to continue.

### Completing your First Course

The information here gets you started on DataCamp's Introduction to R course; however, it is your job now to finish it. DataCamp estimates that this course should take approximately four hours. It's ok if it takes longer than that or shorter than that, but we realize you will likely not do it all at once. The great thing is DataCamp will remember when you left off so when you log back on to DataCamp you can pick up where you left off!
