## Finding help

![Google search](images/01_how_to_google/00_google.png)
<!-- In data science and computer-related work in general, it is common to ask for help multiple times per day. Sometimes we ask our colleagues for help, other times we ask for help from an established figure in the field via a book they wrote. But most frequently, we search the web.  -->

<!-- It is important to realize that other people might have run into the same problem/question we have and that their might be an answer that was publicly shared. In complicated scenarios, maybe others have documented a similar problem to the one you have and that information can be useful for figuring out the answer to yours. Many people contribute their questions and answers freely for others to read through via a wide variety of websites and public forums. That is why we search the web, to find those answers. -->

<!-- So how do we search the web? _Web search engine_ is the term that denotes software that is designed to find the most relevant answers to our question, or _query_. The most common web search engine is Google, which by the way is how the company started before it became so ubiquitous in our lives. We can access _Google_ via [www.google.com](https://www.google.com) where you will see a simple text box and a button called _Google search_. -->
