# Google Sheets

Google Sheets is a free, online spreadsheet program. If you're familiar with Excel, it is similar to Excel. If you are unfamiliar with Excel, that's ok! We'll go through everything you need to know to get started on the project here. And, later in the program, we will go into more details to get you fully comfortable working with Google Sheets. As for right now, just know that when you have data that you want to input into a spreadsheet, Google Sheets is an ok place to start. Google Sheets is great because you never have to worry about saving your work. If you are online, Google Sheets automatically saves your work.

### What is a spreadsheet?

A spreadsheet is a type of document where data are stored in rows and columns of a grid. Each square is referred to as a 'cell' in teh spreadsheet In Google Sheets (and many other spreadsheet programs), the rows are numbered (i.e. 1,2,3) and the columns are specified by capital letters (i.e. A, B, C). 

This way you can refer to any specific spot in the grid. For example, A2 specifies the data in cell in the first column (A) and second row of the spreadsheet. 

For this first project you will collect data and enter it into a Google Sheet. We'll discuss the details of how to do this now.

### Getting started in Google Sheets

To get started and create your first Google Sheet, go to docs.google.com/spreadsheets. 

### Entering Data

### Basics of 'tidy data'



### Collecting data for our project

But we need to store that information somewhere. 

For this project we will be using Google Sheets. You can get to Google Sheets by navigating to the website https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/. You will see something like this.

Now click on the big plus sign and you will get a new spreadsheet that will look like this. 

![Untitled sheet]()

If you click on the words _"Untitled Spreadsheet"_ you can rename the spreadsheet. Type in the words _"leanpub\_data"_ to change the name of your spreadsheet. You should now have a spreadsheet that looks like this. 

![leanpub_data sheet]()



We are almost done, now we just need to label the different kinds of data we are going to collect. Start by clicking on the upper left hand square (called a "cell") and type "title". This will be the column where we are going to store information on the title of the book. 

![leanpub_data sheet with title]()

Then move one square to the right, click and type "readers". This will be where we will store how many readers a book has. Move one more square to the right type "suggested" and then one more square and type "minimum". 

Now you are all set to start collecting data! To do this, go back to the webspage: https://leanpub.com/bookstore. Click on the book and write the title, number of readers, suggested, and minimum prices on a row. When you are doing this make sure that: 

* There are no commas in numbers. Just leave them out. So don't write "1,036" write "1036" instead. 
* You don't put dollar signs for the price, just include the number like "7.99"

So for me, since the first book is "PowerShell 101" after getting the data for the first book my spreadsheet will look like this. 

![First row of data for project]()

Collect information on ten or twenty books. One book for every row. At the end you should have a data set that looks something like this. But yours will have different numbers and names in it. 

![First complete data set]()

This is great! You now have a question you want to answer and you have collected some data to answer that question. You are on your way to becoming a data scientist!
