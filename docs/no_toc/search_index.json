DataTrail is a no-cost, paid 14-week educational initiative for young-adult, high school and GED-graduates. DataTrail aims to equip members of underserved communities with the necessary skills and support required to work in the booming field of data science. DataTrail is a fresh take on workforce development that focuses on training both Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC) interested in the data science industry and their potential employers. Offered by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in partnership with local non-profits and Leanpub, DataTrail combines a mutually-intensive learning experience (MILE) with a whole-person ecosystem of support to allow aspiring data scientists and their employers to succeed. DataTrail uses mutually-intensive learning DataTrail joins aspiring data science scholars and expert-level data scientist mentors in a mutually-intensive learning experience (MILE). In the DataTrail MILE: Scholars engage in cutting-edge technical and soft skills training needed to enter the data science field. Mentors engage in anti-racism and mentorship training needed to be impactful mentors and informed colleagues on diverse data science teams. The social connections created along the way will fuel job opportunities for scholars and foster a more diverse, equitable, and inclusive climate at the mentors’ institutions. { course-completeness: 100 course-attempts: 2 default-quiz-attempts: 2 default-random-choice-order: true default-quiz-show-answers: none } "],["welcome-to-datatrail.html", "Chapter 1 Welcome to DataTrail", " Chapter 1 Welcome to DataTrail Hello and welcome! This is the first course in the DataTrail program. The goal of DataTrail is to help anyone with an internet connection and a computer learn to do data science. The program will start with the very basics of using a computer on the internet and work all the way up to doing data science and data analysis. We hope that by building this program we can help people get into the exciting tech world in one of the fastest growing and most satisfying jobs in the United States. There are only going to be more and more jobs asking for data science skills in the future. We believe that by making this career accessible to anyone we can have a positive impact on the world. 1.0.1 Course Details Before we jump into the content, we just wanted to orient you to how this course and all the courses in this program will be laid out: Courses - There are multiple courses in the DataTrail program. The first one is “Introduction to DataTrail”, which is the course you’re in right now. Lessons - Each course will consist of lessons. You’re looking at the first lesson here. It’s called “Welcome to DataTrail”. You can see a list of all the lessons in this course in the left panel. The lessons will contain text and images to walk you through every lesson of each course. Videos - At the end of each lesson there will be a link to a YouTube video. This video contains the same information as what is included in the text of the lesson; however, we know that some people learn better by listening. Sometimes you may find the videos more helpful. Sometimes you may find the text more helpful. These are included in case they are more helpful than the text to you personally. Slides - Each lesson also has link at the bottom to an accompanying slide show. Feel free to look through these slides if you find them helpful. They are the same images that were used to generate the video. Quizzes - Most lessons will have a quiz to evaluate your understanding of the material in that lesson. Successful completion of these quizzes is required for receipt of the certificate at the end of each course. Exercise - A few of the courses will have associated exercises. Think of these as larger projects. They won’t be required to receive the certificate at the end of the course; however, the skills the exercises require will be essential if you’re interested in getting a job in data science, so we highly suggest you complete them. 1.0.2 What is data science? You might not think about data very much. Most people don’t. So why is data science such a popular and growing career? And what does data science even mean? One definition of data is any information that you can store on a computer. Examples of data that you produce all the time are text messages, Facebook posts, websites you visit, things you buy with a credit card, pictures of your car on speed cameras, and information you fill out in profiles for your work, school, or community organizations. If you can take a picture of it, write about it, make a video of it, or record it on audio - then it is probably data. All of these different kinds of data are collected and saved on a computer. It used to be that measuring and storing data was expensive and hard. Now it is easy and cheap. Governments, companies, organizations, and even individual people can now collect and store more data in a few days than the entire world collected over the last few centuries. Most of the time we don’t even think about the data we are collecting. We take pictures and post them to Facebook to show our grandparents, not because we want to analyze the data in the pictures. This is true for most of the data that we create and collect, both for ourselves and for companies. We don’t do it for the data - we do it because we want to record and share information about ourselves and the world. For example, companies do it so they can keep track of their customers, and governments do it because they want to keep records of who got parking tickets. But people started to figure out that you could use that data for other purposes. When you search for “symptoms of the flu” on Google, you are just looking for information because you are sick. But the data that you are searching for flu symptoms is valuable information for companies, doctors, and even scientists. We could use that data from you to do things like show you an ad for blankets or for flu medicine. We could also use data from you and everyone else who searched for flu symptoms to find out where there are lots of flu cases. Another example is social media. You might write a post on Facebook with pictures describing your child’s birthday party. You might do this so your child’s grandparents can see pictures of her birthday. But the information in that post can again be valuable for other people. We could figure out birthdays, hobbies, interests, and who knows who from Facebook posts and likes. That information can be valuable for showing ads, for suggesting other people you might know, or for studying how humans interact with each other on birthdays and holidays. But to make data valuable we need to be able to study it and separate the interesting facts (called the “signal”) from the uninteresting information (the “noise”). One definition for data science is that. “Data science is asking a question that can be answered with data, collecting and cleaning the data, studying the data, creating models to help understand and answer the question, and sharing the answer to the question with other people.” The reason this field is growing so fast is that nearly every government, company, and organization is now collecting data. As the data have become cheaper and cheaper, the ability to analyze that data and find useful information has become a more and more valuable skill. But most people don’t have training or experience sifting through big piles of data to make interesting and valuable discoveries. The people who can do this well are called data scientists. They have a job that is exciting, interesting, and promises to be in high demand for years to come. 1.0.3 What is DataTrail? Data science is a fast-growing and exciting profession. But it can be a challenge to get into this career. Some of the biggest challenges are: Finding out that data science is even a real career Getting an education in data science can be costly and inconvenient You usually need a background in math, statistics, or computer science The equipment for data science can be costly and difficult to set up Many of the jobs are only available in major cities Most of the people who are currently data scientists have degrees in math, statistics, physics. They can afford computers that cost thousands of dollars and specialized computing software to help them do their jobs. They also mostly live in a few major cities like New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington D.C. Many of these data scientists are former software engineers or other white-collar workers who moved into data science when they saw the demand for this kind of job. It is our goal with DataTrail to try to help people who would otherwise not have access to this exciting career to get into the career. To do that we need to remove some of the challenges above. So we designed this program to tackle some of the challenges that are preventing more widespread adoption of this career. DataTrail is being released as a set of online courses with a pay-what-you-can model. That means you can take the whole series of courses for free or for whatever cost you can afford. DataTrail is designed to be done entirely online using only tools you can access from a web browser. This means that you can do the entire program on a Chromebook - which you can get for as little as $150. DataTrail starts at the very basics of how to set up all of your accounts, which websites and apps to use, and simple little projects that anyone can do. The only pre-requisites are high school math/reading and the ability to use a computer. DataTrail includes resources for finding, getting, and working at data science jobs. It also includes resources for finding and working at remote data science jobs that can be done from anywhere in the world. 1.0.4 Who is this program for? DataTrail is designed for people who have a high school education and know how to use a computer. Some people who we hope the program will be useful for are: High school students People who are working on or have completed a high school education Students at community colleges Older adults who want to learn something new But the program can be completed by anyone! We hope that it will be useful for anyone who wants to learn something new about data science. This program is also focused on people who want to learn to do data science. In some cases this program may not be the most efficient way to learn about data science. If you already have a background in statistics, math, or computer science and want to jump directly to more advanced topics we have already created a Data Science Specialization on Coursera just for you. There are many jobs that require people to understand or manage a data science project. If you are a leader or executive who just wants a high level overview of what data science is all about, we have also created an Executive Data Science Specialization. Our goal here is also to create a supportive and inclusive learning experience. Data science is frustrating and slow to learn. Often the best way is to learn from other people who have discovered similar solutions or made similar mistakes. Fortunately, there are communities in data science that are cheerful, friendly and willing to help new people get involved. Throughout the program we will introduce you to these communities and hope that you will also make an effort to help your fellow students as they discover this exciting field. 1.0.5 How the program is organized This program is a series of online classes. They are designed to be used in many different ways so they can be useful for the most people possible. The courses and projects can be completed entirely online using nothing more than a web browser. The program is organized into Courses: Courses are designed to be able to be done in about a month working in your spare time or day or two working full time. You can receive a certificate for each course and all courses are based on a pay-what-you-can model. Each course consists of: Text based tutorials and lessons Slides with the images from the tutorials Video tutorials that cover the same information as the lessons Ungraded exercises to practice what you have learned Graded quizzes to measure what you have learned Projects to help you build a portfolio for showing what you’ve learned Course Set: A Course Set is a group of courses that form credentials. To keep up on the latest information about the program, courses and more go to https://www.DataTrail.org/. 1.0.6 How this course is graded This first class is designed to get you set up with the accounts you will use as you learn to become a data scientist. You will also complete your first data science project. Each lesson will have a short quiz at the end. To pass the course you need to get 70% of the questions in the course correct. If you receive more than 90% of the points across all quizzes you will pass with honors. 1.0.7 Slides and Video Welcome to Cloud-Based Data Science Slides "],["program-philosophy.html", "Chapter 2 Program Philosophy", " Chapter 2 Program Philosophy Our philosophy with building this course and this program is to try to make data science accessible to the widest audience possible. This course is part of the DataTrail series of courses. These courses are designed to tackle some of the challenges that prevent people from getting into data science in the first place. Some of those challenges are geographic - we’ll talk more about that later. Some are due to the price of education - that is why we are offering these courses as MOOCs. But one of the key barriers is that the type of computer you usually need to do data science is expensive. Chromebooks, on the other hand, are a very cheap type of computer. Chromebooks aren’t exactly like normal computers and they have a few unique characteristics: They are usually very cheap They are designed mostly to use the web You don’t “install” any software on the computer itself Instead of “apps” and “software” you simply go to websites for your work A simple way to think about it is that a Chromebook is a computer that only lets you use an internet browser like Chrome. You can’t really do much on the computer itself. Some people call this way of working - working only through the internet - “cloud computing”. It’s called cloud computing because the computer you are using most of the time is not the one sitting in front of you. You are using the internet to access tools and computers to do your work. But the physical computers doing the work are stored somewhere else - it could be nearby or on the other side of the globe. That is why people call the computers “in the cloud”. The goal of DataTrail is not that you have to use a Chromebook to finish the program, it is just that you could use a Chromebook to finish the whole program. You can finish the entire sequence of courses using any computer with an internet connection and a web browser. We took this approach because we want data science to be accessible to everyone. We have found that in earlier classes we taught online, the cost of computers, difficulties installing software, and lack of computing resources prevented students from completing our courses. We wanted to strip all those barriers away so that more students would have access to our program. We also believe that the future of data science is increasingly cloud based. So this educational choice matches a trend we see in the field that we can help you take advantage of. It is less and less likely that you will work only on your laptop as a data scientist. Through the internet you will access data and computing power so that you can magnify the impact of what you are working on. We hope to show you how to use those resources to maximize the value you can bring as a new data scientist. We do recognize that internet access is also a limiting factor for many people. We have tried to make it so that you don’t have to download data so hopefully the broadband requirements will be minimal. We hope that if internet access is a challenge for you that you can leverage the resources you have - whether they are local libraries, coffee shops, or internet cafes to complete this program. If that isn’t an option for you we’d love to hear from you and see if we can find ways to make data science accessible to everyone, everywhere. 2.0.1 Slides and Video Program Philosophy Slides "],["why-automated-videos.html", "Chapter 3 Why Automated Videos", " Chapter 3 Why Automated Videos What’s the deal with these videos? And why do the videos say almost exactly the same thing as the printed lecture material? You have probably already noticed that the lectures and videos for this class are structured a little differently than in many MOOCs you have taken. We created this video to explain to you why we made this change and why we think it highlights the awesome power of R and data science. We create a lot of massive online open courses at the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab. We have created more than 30 courses on multiple platforms over the last 5 years. Our goal with these classes is to provide the best and most up to date information to the broadest audience possible. But there are significant challenges to maintaining this much material online. R packages go out of date, new workflows are invented, and typos - oh the typos! We used to make these courses like many other universities. We’d create course material in the form of lecture slides, then we’d record videos of ourselves delivering those lectures. In some ways this was great - you actually got to hear our voices delivering your lectures, including all the “yawns”, “ums”, “buts”, and “so’s”. But the downside is that it is difficult and time consuming to update the content when we have to book a recording studio, set up special equipment, record ourselves delivering a lecture, edit those lectures, and then upload them to a system. The result is that a lot of our lectures have been out of date, include errors, or don’t include the latest, best versions of workflows and pipelines. This has been a problem for a while, but as the number of courses we offer grows, it has become more and more of a challenge for us to keep them up to date. So we started to think about how to solve this challenging problem. We realized that while recording and editing videos is extremely time consuming there is another type of content we can edit, update, and maintain much more frequently - regular old plain text documents. We aren’t the only ones who have thought this - massive online open course innovators like Lorena Barba have been saying that videos aren’t even necessary for these types of courses. So when we sat down to develop our new process for creating and maintaining our courses we wanted to see if we could figure out how to make a class made entirely out of plain text documents. We broke down a massive online open course into its basic elements: Tutorials - these we can easily write in plain text formats like markdown or R markdown. Slides - these are easy enough to maintain and share if we make them with something like Google Slides. Assessments - here we can use a markup language to create quizzes and other assessments. Videos - this was the sticking point, how were we going to make videos from plain text documents? By a happy coincidence, the data science and artificial intelligence communities were solving a huge part of this problem for us, improving text to voice synthesis! So we could now write a script for a video and use Amazon Polly to synthesize our voices! To take advantage of this new technology we created two new R packages: ari and didactr. Ari will take a script and a set of Google Slides and narrate the script over the slides using Amazon Polly. It will also generate the closed caption file needed to include captions and ensure that the videos are accessible to those with hearing impairment. didactr automates several of the steps from creating the videos with ari, to uploading them to YouTube, so that we can quickly make edits to the scripts or slides, remake the videos, re-upload them and reduce our maintenance overhead for keeping our content fresh. Whenever we change the text file or edit the slides we can recreate the video in a couple of minutes. Everything is done in R. One of the coolest features of going to this new process is showing you how powerful the R programming language is. This is the main language you will learn in this program and we hope you will be able to build cool things like this system by the time you are done with our courses. Why did we choose this approach instead of creating each piece of a lesson separately? Well, first, this process makes it a lot easier for us to maintain and update the courses. If you report an issue or find a mistake with a lesson, all we need to do is to change these two files and recreate the courses again. Therefore, we will have a more efficient way of maintaining the course content and updating it. Second, by using this process we have made our instruction more accessible. Since videos have transcripts and transcripts have voice over, the content is accessible by those of us who have disabilities. For everyone else, you can have a choice of reading versus listening versus watching the content as you wish. Finally, a cool feature of using text to speech synthesis is that our videos will keep getting better as the voice synthesis software improves. It means that we can change the voice to different voices. Ultimately, it will allow us to translate our courses into different languages quickly and automatically using machine learning. We think this highlights the incredible power of data science and artificial intelligence to improve the world. If you find the robot voice annoying, we get it. We know that the technology isn’t perfect yet. That’s why we’ve made the written lecture material reflect as closely as possible the video lectures. This means that you don’t have to watch these videos. Using this setup, you can pick how you want to consume our classes. We hope that this change will allow us to better serve you with the best content at the fastest speed. Thanks for participating in this new phase of course development with us! 3.0.1 Slides and Video Why Automated Videos Slides "],["the-data-science-process.html", "Chapter 4 The Data Science Process", " Chapter 4 The Data Science Process In the first few lessons of this course we discussed what data is and talked about the fact that data are everywhere. We also introduced you to the philosophy of this program: that everyone should have access to the knowledge needed to become a data scientist and that these materials should be able to be updated with ease as technologies and methodologies change over time. What we haven’t yet covered is what an actual data science project looks like. To do so, we’ll first step through an actual data science project, breaking down the parts of a typical project and then, provide a number of links to other interesting data science projects. Our goal in this lesson is to expose you to the process one goes through as they carry out data science projects. 4.0.1 The Parts of a Data Science Project Every Data Science Project starts with a question that is to be answered with data. That means that forming the question is an important first step in the process. The second step is finding or generating the data you’re going to use to answer that question. With the question solidified and data in hand, the data are then analyzed, first by exploring the data and then often by modeling the data, which means using some statistical or machine learning techniques to analyze the data and answer your question. After drawing conclusions from this analysis, the project has to be communicated to others. Sometimes this is a report you send to your boss or team at work. Other times it’s a blog post. Often it’s a presentation to a group of colleagues. Regardless, a data science project almost always involves some form of communication of the projects’ findings. We’ll walk through these steps using a data science project example below. 4.0.2 A Data Science Project Example For this example, we’re going to use an example analysis from a data scientist named Hilary Parker. Her work can be found on her blog, and the specific project we’ll be working through here is from 2013 and titled “Hilary: the most poisoned baby name in US history”. To get the most out of this lesson, click on that link and read through Hilary’s post. Once you’re done, come on back to this lesson and read through the breakdown of this post. Hilary’s blog post 4.0.2.1 The Question When setting out on a data science project, it’s always great to have your question well-defined. Additional questions may pop up as you do the analysis, but knowing what you want to answer with your analysis is a really important first step. Hilary Parker’s question is included in bold in her post. Highlighting this makes it clear that she’s interested in answer the following question: Is Hilary/Hillary really the most rapidly poisoned name in recorded American history? 4.0.2.2 The Data To answer this question, Hilary collected data from the Social Security website. This dataset included the 1000 most popular baby names from 1880 until 2011. 4.0.2.3 Data Analysis As explained in the blog post, Hilary was interested in calculating the relative risk for each of the 4,110 different names in her dataset from one year to the next from 1880 to 2011. By hand, this would be a nightmare. Thankfully, by writing code in R, all of which is available on GitHub, Hilary was able to generate these values for all these names across all these years. It’s not important at this point in time to fully understand what a relative risk calculation is (although Hilary does a great job breaking it down in her post!), but it is important to know that after getting the data together, the next step is figuring out what you need to do with that data in order to answer your question. For Hilary’s question, calculating the relative risk for each name from one year to the next from 1880 to 2011 and looking at the percentage of babies named each name in a particular year would be what she needed to do to answer her question. Hilary’s GitHub repo for this project 4.0.2.3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis What you don’t see in the blog post is all of the code Hilary wrote to get the data from the Social Security website, to get it in the format she needed to do the analysis, and to generate the figures. As mentioned above, she made all this code available on GitHub so that others could see what she did and repeat her steps if they wanted. In addition to this code, data science projects often involve writing a lot of code and generating a lot of figures that aren’t included in your final results. This is part of the data science process too. Figuring out how to do what you want to do to answer your question of interest is part of the process, doesn’t always show up in your final project, and can be very time-consuming. 4.0.2.3.2 Data Analysis Results That said, given that Hilary now had the necessary values calculated, she began to analyze the data. The first thing she did was look at the names with the biggest drop in percentage from one year to the next. By this preliminary analysis, Hilary was sixth on the list, meaning there were five other names that had had a single year drop in popularity larger than the one the name “Hilary” experienced from 1992 to 1993. Biggest Drop Table In looking at the results of this analysis, the first five years appeared peculiar to Hilary Parker. (It’s always good to consider whether or not the results were what you were expecting, from any analysis!) None of them seemed to be names that were popular for long periods of time. To see if this hunch was true, Hilary plotted the percent of babies born each year with each of the names from this table. What she found was that, among these “poisoned” names (names that experienced a big drop from one year to the next in popularity), all of the names other than Hilary became popular all of a sudden and then dropped off in popularity. Hilary Parker was able to figure out why most of these other names became popular, so definitely read that section of her post! The name, Hilary, however, was different. It was popular for a while and then completely dropped off in popularity. 14 most poisoned names over time To figure out what was specifically going on with the name Hilary, she removed names that became popular for short periods of time before dropping off, and only looked at names that were in the top 1000 for more than 20 years. The results from this analysis definitively show that Hilary had the quickest fall from popularity in 1992 of any female baby name between 1880 and 2011. (“Marian”’s decline was gradual over many years.) 39 most poisoned names over time, controlling for fads 4.0.2.4 Communication The final step in this data analysis process was, once Hilary Parker had answered her question on her computer, it was time to share it with the world. An important part of any data science project is effectively communicating the results of the project. Hilary did so by writing a wonderful blog post that communicated the results of her analysis, answered the question she set out to answer, and did so in an entertaining way. Additionally, it’s important to note that most projects build off someone else’s work. It’s really important to give those people credit. Hilary accomplishes this by: linking to a blog post where someone had asked a similar question previously linking to the Social Security website where she got the data linking to a link about where she learned about web scraping 4.0.3 What you can build using R Hilary’s work was carried out using the R programming language. Throughout the courses in this series, you’ll learn the basics of programming in R, exploring and analyzing data, and how to build reports and web applications that allow you to effectively communicate your results. To give you an example of the types of things that can be built using the R programming and suite of available tools that use R, below are a few examples of the types of things that have been built using the data science process and the R programming language - the types of things that you’ll be able to generate by the end of this series of courses. 4.0.3.1 Prediction Risk of Opioid Overdoses in Providence, RI Masters students at the University of Pennsylvania set out to predict the risk of opioid overdoses in Providence, Rhode Island. They include details on the data they used, the steps they took to clean their data, their visualization process, and their final results. While the details aren’t important now, seeing the process and what types of reports can be generated is important. Additionally, they’ve created a Shiny App, which is an interactive web application. This means that you can choose what neighborhood in Providence you want to focus on. All of this was built using R programming. Prediction of Opioid Overdoses in Providence, RI 4.0.4 Other Cool Data Science Projects The following are smaller projects than the example above, but data science projects nonetheless! In each project, the author had a question they wanted to answer and used data to answer that question. They explored, visualized, and analyzed the data. Then, they wrote blog posts to communicate their findings. Take a look to learn more about the topics listed and to see how others work through the data science project process and communicate their results. Text analysis of Trump’s tweets confirms he writes only the (angrier) Android half, by David Robinson Where to Live in the US, by Maelle Salmon Sexual Health Clinics in Toronto, by Sharla Gelfand 4.0.5 Conclusions In this lesson, we hope we’ve conveyed that sometimes data science projects are tackling difficult questions (‘Can we predict the risk of opioid overdose?’) while other times the goal of the project is to answer a question you’re interested in personally (‘Is Hilary the most rapidly poisoned baby name in recorded American History?’). In either case, the process is similar. You have to form your question, get data, explore and analyze your data, and communicate your results. With the tools you’ll learn in this series of courses, you will be able to set out and carry out your own data science projects, like the examples included in this lesson! 4.0.6 Slides and Video The Data Science Process Slides "],["how-to-learn.html", "Chapter 5 How To Learn", " Chapter 5 How To Learn In the last lesson we walked through a few interesting data science projects. Eventually, using the foundational skills learned in the courses throughout this Course Set, with practice on your own, and with other skills you pick up along the way, you’ll be completing your own, equally-awesome data science projects. However, what many people don’t tell you early on is that that path will be paved with a lot of failure. This isn’t a bad thing! Data scientists fail all the time. They write code that produces an error they have to figure out. And they regularly have to abandon projects that aren’t going to work out. Failure is part of the process. Failure Even when a project is successful, know that there was failure on the way to success! The problem is that what you see in a final blog post or a product put out by data scientists at a company is the final product. This product may be something that is functional, really important, or even beautiful. What you don’t see is all the failure that happened on the way to getting the end product. Data science projects can be a lot like social media accounts. On social media, it’s easy to only show the good stuff about one’s life. For data science projects, the end product of a data science project may be awesome, so the user will only see the good stuff. But, there’s a lot of struggle and failure that went into creating the awesome end product! success requires failure In fact, that pathway to success in data science is always full of failure. And, often, failure followed by figuring out why you just failed is a great way to learn. That doesn’t make failure easier. It will be frustrating from time to time, and figuring out why something isn’t working can be hard. That’s ok! Know that you’re not alone. Even experienced data scientists who have built really cool stuff experience lots of failure along the way. process can be difficult 5.0.1 Learning How To Learn In addition to learning the basics of data science in this course set, we also want you to learn how to learn. First and foremost, the best way to learn data science is by doing it. Throughout these lessons, copy the code you see in the lessons and try it out on your own. If you get an error, that’s ok! Google that error and try to learn from this error! In fact, we’ve got a whole lesson in this course on how to Google and a lesson in a later course in this course set on how to get help for questions when you’re programming. But, there’s more to learning how to learn than getting good at searching on the Internet (although, that is important!) 5.0.1.1 The Mindset To learn how to learn, it’s important to know just how important your mindset is. Your goal should be to answer an interesting question. Your objective is not to memorize a bunch of functions. It’s to use those functions to do something interesting. The path to accomplishing that goal may be circuitous. You may take a few steps backward and experience a setback or two before moving forward. That’s ok! mindset 5.0.1.2 The Path When carrying out a data science projects, there is always more than one way to solve a problem. Your path may be different than someone else’s path. In fact, while you may not know R code yet, the following four lines of code all produce the exact same output: mtcars %&gt;% tidyr::gather(key = variable, value = value) tidyr::gather(mtcars, key = variable, value = value) mtcars %&gt;% tidyr::gather(key = variable) mtcars_long &lt;- tidyr::gather(mtcars, key = variable) Any one of these would be a reasonable approach. We use this example to explain that there is more than one way to approach and to answer a question! Your path may be different than someone else’s. Your approaches may not be identical. And, that is more than ok! path 5.0.1.3 Asking For Help While we’ll point out where to find help when you’re stuck throughout this course set; however, it may not be obvious when to ask for help. While this is not a hard and fast rule, if you’ve been trying to find the answer to something you’re stuck on for half an hour and cannot figure it out, it may be time to post your question online for someone else to answer or to reach out directly to someone to get your question answered. During the half hour when you’re trying on your own, you should Google for the answer. If it’s a coding question, you should try running code to test to see if the fixes from Google fix your problem. If you’re getting error messages, paste those messages into Google. If after trying all of these things you’re still stuck, then you should ask for help every time. Rather than give up because you’re stuck, ask questions! Ask Questions 5.0.2 Summary Learning how to learn and asking questions may seem simple when you read this lesson, but in practice it can be tough. It’s hard to admit you don’t know something and it can be difficult sometimes to explain what it is you don’t know. Try anyway! Everyone was a beginner at some point. Those who moved from beginner to advanced did so because they learned the material, practiced and because they asked questions along the way. We’ll remind you of the information included in this lesson throughout the course set because while it’s easy to read the information here, it’s not always easy to remember it when you’re struggling! 5.0.3 Slides and Video How To Learn Slides "],["finding-help.html", "Chapter 6 Finding Help", " Chapter 6 Finding Help In data science and computer-related work in general, it is common to ask for help multiple times per day. While sometimes we ask our colleagues for help in-person, most of the time we search the web. Throughout this coursework it may surprise you just how frequently other people have run into the same problem or had the exact same question you have. Often, there is an answer that was publicly shared previously on the Internet that can help answer the very question you’re asking. There are a number of websites and discussion boards where people frequently ask and answer questions. By knowing how to effectively search the web, you can easily find these answers. 6.0.1 Searching the Internet You’ve been working on the Internet through this coursework so far on the Chrome Browser? Within every Internet browser, you have access to web search engines. These are designed to find the most relevant answers to our question. The most common web search engine is Google. In fact, Google started as a web search engine before it developed any of the other many products it offers today.We can access Google by typing www.google.com in the search bar at the top of the Chrome browser. This will bring you to the Google homepage, where you will see a simple text box and a button called Google search. Google search On the search box, as you start typing your question you will see suggestions based on what you have written so far. This is called Google auto-complete. Here is an example where Google suggests a few common searches that start with “how to find help in”. Google auto-complete The auto-complete feature can be useful because it helps us refine our search query which will lead to more relevant results and answers. Throughout this course work, we’ll be using the R programming language to complete data analyses. Thus, you will often be searching for help related to the R programming language. So, in this example, let’s select “how to find help in r” and then click on the Google search button, we will get a list of websites that are most related to our question as shown below. Google search results Google highlights some of our key terms from our search in the search results list. For example, the word help is bolded twice on the first link title “R: Getting Help with R”. Each search result includes a short title, the web link, a short extract from the website, and some of our search terms (words) highlighted. Using this information we have to decide if our search was specific enough. For example, we could have searched “how to get help”. Google search would have had no way of knowing that we had an R question specifically. Alternatively, searching “how to get help for all the questions I’ve ever had or may have in the R programming language today or tomorrow” is also not ideal. Devising a search with the fewest words that help accurately answer your questions is the goal! We will cover different ways of finding help. Throughout this coursework, you’ll likely learn that part of being a data scientist means being good at Googling. Effectively searching the web is an important skill to have. 6.0.2 Search Guidelines The best way to get a response to your question is to be able to boil it down to relatively few words. Less is usually better…it’s also faster to type too! So, when you’re Googling things, keep a few things in mind: Use the fewest words possible - full sentences and correct grammar are not necessary when searching google Be Specific - include words that are important to your specific search Know specific websites where you can get help - while Google is generally a great place to start, sometimes it can be helpful to know specific websites where you can get help. StackOverflow Basecamp and the RStudio Community will likely be helpful places as you learn to program in R. These resources will be covered in detail in a future course; however, it’s good at this point to know they exist Finding Help Slides "],["account-setup.html", "Chapter 7 Account Setup", " Chapter 7 Account Setup Before we can get started doing fun things with data we need to make sure you are set up to use all of the different accounts that you will need throughout the course. We will tell you briefly what each of these accounts is used for and how to set it up now. If you don’t know what each of these accounts is for exactly, don’t worry! We will walk you through everything you need to know. 7.0.1 Choosing a Username Choosing an appropriate username is important. Some combination of your first and last name is a good idea. For example, if your name were Jane Doe, a username such as “JaneDoe” or “Jane.Doe” would work. If the first username you attempt is taken, you can try another, similar username. In this case, maybe try “JDoe”. But, be sure that whatever name you choose, you would be comfortable sharing it with your boss or family member. Usernames with nicknames or profanity are not a good idea. What to Avoid in Usernames 7.0.2 Using a Consistent Username Remembering different usernames for different accounts is difficult. It is best to make your life easy and use the same username whenever possible. We will make your life easy by using the Google Account you set up in the next section whenever possible. When it’s not possible to log in with Google, then we suggest you try to use the same username for each account. 7.0.3 Accounts To give you an idea of where we’re going, the first account (and arguably the most important account) you set up in the next lesson will be a Google account. After that we will walk you through the steps to get you set up with accounts on: LinkedIn - this is a site to share information about yourself with employers. Twitter - this is a social media site that we will use to share our data science products and get support from the data science community. Basecamp - this is a website where you will be able to chat online with your fellow students and instructors. RStudio Cloud - this is a website where you can use Rstudio, the main tool to learn data science. GitHub - this is a website where we will share the results of our data science projects with each other and the world. Accounts 7.0.4 Slides and Video Account Setup Slides "],["google-account-setup.html", "Chapter 8 Google Account Setup", " Chapter 8 Google Account Setup The first and most important account we need to set up will be a Google account. You will need a Google account to be able to use free Google products. These Google products, such as Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides will be useful in many of the Data Science projects you complete. The Google account will also be useful for letting you get access to other websites we will use in the program. Google Products If you already have a Google account with an appropriate username that you would like to use throughout this course, you can skip the next section and move to the “Log off Guest Chromebook” section. However, it’s probably best to create a new account dedicated to all your Data Science accounts, many of which you will set up in the next lesson. 8.0.1 Getting a Google Login To get a Google account, you will first want to open a new tab in your current Chrome session. To do this, you’ll first click on the small gray box to the right of the tab you currently have open. Google website Once this new tab is open, type in ‘www.gmail.com’ in the web address bar at the top of your Chrome session. After clicking enter, you will be brought to a Login screen. Here, you will click on “More options” Google Sign in You will then click on “Create account” to start the process of getting a Google Login. Google Create Account Begin filling in the blank spaces in the box to the right with your information. Google will alert you if the username you’ve chosen has already been taken. Once you’ve filled out all the blanks, click on “Next Step” at the bottom right. Google Blank Form You’ll be asked to read the “Privacy and Terms.” To scroll through the entire document, click on the blue arrow in the middle at the bottom of the document. After reading over the Privacy and Terms, click “I AGREE” to continue. You will then be asked to verify your account. To do so, ensure that a valid phone number for you is in the ‘Phone number’ box. Select whether you prefer to be contacted by “Text message (SMS)” or ‘Voice Call’. Click ‘Continue’ once the information has been entered. You will then be sent a verification code by text message or by phone call, depending on your choice to this question. Enter the verification code into the box on the screen and click “Continue”. Congratulations!! You now have a Google username and account! Be sure to remember your username and password! This will be used for your email address (Gmail) and all other Google products. Google Welcome! 8.0.2 Log Off Guest Chromebook At this point, you’ll want to log off the Chromebook you’re using as a Guest and sign in using your Google Username. To do so, click on ‘Guest’ at the very bottom right-hand of the screen. Click ‘Exit guest’ on the screen that pops up. This will log you off of the Chromebook so you can re-login in using your Google account. Chromebook Log Off 8.0.3 Re-Login using Google Account You will now be on the Chromebook login screen. To sign in using your Google account, click ‘Add person’ at the bottom of the login screen. Chromebook Add Person A ‘Sign in to your Chromebook’ screen will open. Chromebook Sign in Enter your new Google account name here. Click ‘Next’. Enter your password. Click ‘Next.’ You will now be logged on. Anytime you work on this Chromebook now, you will simply log in using your new Google account. 8.0.4 Slides and Video Google Account Setup Slides "],["other-accounts-setup.html", "Chapter 9 Other Accounts Setup", " Chapter 9 Other Accounts Setup In addition to having a Google username, there are a number of other accounts to which you’ll need access. By the end of this lesson, you will have set up a number of different accounts. While this may seem like a lot of work now, it will get you set up with all the accounts you’ll need throughout this series of courses. The time you spend now will pay off later! Right now, we’ll walk through each one briefly, get you set up with an account, and discuss what the account is used for. 9.0.1 LinkedIn Account LinkedIn is a social networking site for employment. Think of it as Facebook for getting a job. It allows you to put your qualifications online (like an online resume), has a space where you can look for jobs, and can put you in contact with employers. Don’t worry about the details now. Through this program, you will have the chance to set up your LinkedIn gradually. For right now, we’re just worried about getting this account set up. To begin set up, you’ll go to the web address bar in your Chrome browser. You will type www.linkedin.com and hit ‘Enter.’ LinkedIn website This will bring you to LinkedIn’s login screen. On this screen you’ll begin filling out the boxes in the middle of the screen. Be sure to use the Gmail username you just created in the last chapter when asked for your Email address. Choose a password that cannot be easily guessed by someone else. Once the four boxes are filled in, click “Join now”. LinkedIn Blank Form A screen may pop up asking you to verify that you’re not a robot. Whenever this happens, just click on the empty square box to let the computer know you’re a real person. Not a robot After clicking “Join now” (and maybe after you verify that you are a human) you will be brought to a new screen. Here, at the top, it will show you that you almost have a LinkedIn login but that first you have to confirm your email address. To do so, you will open a new tab at the top of the Chrome browser window. You will then type in ‘www.gmail.com’ and click ‘Enter.’ gmail website This will bring you to your email account. An email from ‘LinkedIn Messages’ should be there. Click on that email to open it. Verify email from LinkedIn In that email there will be a button where you can click to ‘Confirm your email’. LinkedIn Confirm Your Email This will open a new screen where your google username will be in the box already. Click ‘Continue’ on this screen. LinkedIn Continue While other boxes may pop up for you to go further on LinkedIn and get your profile set up, this is all you have to do for now. You now have a LinkedIn username and account! We will now go through similar processes for the other accounts needed in this program. 9.0.2 Twitter Account The second account you will need will be a Twitter account. You may already be familiar with Twitter; however, data scientists tend to use Twitter for work rather than socializing. Twitter is a social media platform where users can “post and interact with messages.” These messages are known as ‘tweets.’ Twitter is a great place to learn new things, connect with other data scientists, and to ask/answer questions quickly. You will need a professional Twitter account for our program. If you already have a Twitter account you use for personal tweets and communicating with friends you should still create a new, professional account where you will only post professional links and interact with other data scientists. To get a Twitter account, first type ‘www.twitter.com’ in the search bar at the top of your Chrome session. Twitter website This will bring you to a screen where at the top right you’ll want to click ‘Sign up’. Twitter sign in This will bring you to a screen that prompts you for some information and asks you to create a new password. After filling out the information, you will click ‘Sign up.’ Twitter sign in You will be brought to a screen asking for your phone number. After entering your phone number, you will click ‘Next.’ Twitter phone number This will bring you to a screen where you will choose a username. This will be what your Twitter ‘handle’ will be. For simplicity, it would be best for your Gmail username and Twitter handle to be the same (ie if your Gmail address is Jane.Doe@gmail.com, ‘Jane.Doe’ would be a great Twitter username). If that name is unavailable, choose a different, but appropriate and simple, Twitter username. Once you have chosen a Twitter username, click ‘Next’. Twitter username At this point you will be brought to a screen that will have a button saying ‘Let’s go!’ This will lead you to set up your profile further, which is not needed at this time. Instead, go to your gmail, look for an email from ‘Twitter’ and click on the email. Twitter Let’s go! In this email, there will be a ‘Confirm now’ button to click. To verify your Twitter account, click on this button. Twitter Confirm now Congrats! You now have a Twitter account! 9.0.3 Basecamp Account Slack is a place where teams of people can easily communicate and work together on a project. As a data scientist, you are often working in a group on a project. Basecamp is a place where everyone working on that project can communicate. Basecamp is where communication throughout this course will happen. You will be able to ask questions, answer questions, and communicate with others on Basecamp about the things you are learning and the projects you are working on. To get a Basecamp account, you will first open a new tab in your browser by typing ctrl and t. Once you have a new tab open, you will type ‘www.Basecamp.com’ at the top of your browser in the web address bar. Basecamp Web Address On this webpage, type your Gmail address in the ‘email address’ box, and click ‘GET STARTED.’ Basecamp Get Started! We won’t be signing into any workspaces yet; however, later in the program, when we do, you will have an account! That’s all you need to do with Basecamp for now! 9.0.4 RStudio Cloud Account As a data scientist A LOT of your work will be done in something called RStudio. In this program, you will be learning the basics of the programming language, R. R is a free programming language for statistical computing and graphics. In other words, the code you write to work with data will all be done in R. RStudio Cloud is the place (or ‘platform’) where you will type this code and make basic plots. Luckily, RStudio Cloud makes it easy to sign up. You will first go to ‘rstudio.cloud’. Note: This web address does not start with ‘www.’ rstudio.cloud web address This will bring you to a screen where you can click on ‘Get Started.’ This will bring you to a login screen where, instead of typing in your information, since you already have a Google account, just click on ‘Sign up with Google.’ rstudio.cloud sign up with Google You will be prompted to choose which Google account you want to use. Choose your professional Google account. Then, you will be brought to a screen where you will have to enter a username. Again, for simplicity, try to use the same username across all accounts. rstudio.cloud choose account Then, click ‘Create Account’ and you’re all set! You now have an RStudio Cloud account! 9.0.5 GitHub Account GitHub is a website that hosts computer code and allows for version control. We’ll get back to what version control is later, but as for now, know that GitHub is where you’ll be ‘saving’ all of the code you write. It’s also a place where you can look at other people’s code. And, throughout this program, you’ll realize that you can learn a lot from other people’s code! To get a GitHub account, first type www.github.com into the web address bar at the top of your Chrome window and hit ‘Enter’. GitHub web address You will be brought to a page where you should fill in your information. As with the other accounts, try to use the same Username if possible. Enter your Gmail Email address. And, create a password that cannot be easily guessed by others. Then, click ‘Sign up for GitHub.’ One final note about GitHub usernames in particular. This will be used for your website (which you’ll build later) and all the code you write. You’ll use GitHub a lot, so this is a case where it is particularly helpful to choose a good username, particularly one that has something to do with your name and not much else. For example, the person writing this lesson is named Shannon Ellis. Her GitHub username is “ShanEllis.” While it is possible to change your GitHub username down the line, it’s a bit of a pain, so choose wisely now! You now have a GitHub account and all of the online accounts needed for this program! 9.0.6 Slides and Video Other Accounts Setup Slides "],["your-first-data-science-project.html", "Chapter 10 Your First data science project", " Chapter 10 Your First data science project We are using this definition of data science. “Data science is asking a question that can be answered with data, collecting and cleaning the data, studying the data, creating models to help understand and answer the question, and sharing the answer to the question with other people.” Rather than try to explain data science with examples made by other people, we are going to show you the process of data science through a project that you will complete. The first step in any data science project is to come up with a question. You are taking this course on Leanpub. Leanpub is a website where you can sell books and courses. For this first project the question we are trying to answer is: “How does the price of a bestselling book relate to how much the author is charging for that book?” This question isn’t about data. It is just something we might be curious about. In this case, if you were going to write and sell a book on Leanpub you might want to know what price to pick in order to try to sell the most books. Many good data science questions don’t start out with data. They are just questions you wish that you knew the answer to. Later, you try to find out if there is data to answer your question. In this case, to answer our question, we need some information on books on the Leanpub website. If you go to https://leanpub.com/bookstore you will see a website that looks like this. Leanpub bookstore website This shows the bestseller books for the last week. If you click on one of the pictures of a book you can get some information on that book. If I click on the page for the first book “PowerShell 101” I see something like this. Powershell 101 landing page on Leanpub It will probably be a different book for you since it will be a different weekly bestseller. But you can look in the top left corner and see how many people read the book. This information is there for most books, but is sometimes missing if the author decides not to publish that number. In this case there are 1,036 total readers of this book. Number of readers for Powershell 101 Next we can find out the suggested price. This is on the right hand side and is the price the author thinks is the appropriate price for their book. In this case the suggested price is $15.99. Suggested price for Powershell 101 But one nice thing about Leanpub is that you can set up a “pay what you want” model where people can choose how much they pay for a book. When authors do this, there is also a minimum price they set for the book. If there is a minimum price it is also on the right hand side. In this case the minimum price is $7.99. Minimum price for Powershell 101 We could do this for each book and then we’d have a nice data set that would tell us something about the number of readers for a book and the price of that book. Then we could start to look at the numbers we collected and see if we see any patterns to the data that we have collected to try to answer our question. We’ll go through the steps necessary to do all of this and answer the project question “How does the price of a bestselling book relate to how much the author is charging for that book?” in the following lessons. 10.0.1 Slides and Video Your First Data Science Project Slides "],["google-sheets.html", "Chapter 11 Google Sheets", " Chapter 11 Google Sheets Google Sheets is a free, online spreadsheet program. If you’re familiar with Excel, it is similar to Excel. If you are unfamiliar with Excel, that’s ok! We’ll go through everything you need to know to get started on the project here. And, later in the program, we will go into more details to get you fully comfortable working with Google Sheets. As for right now, just know that when you have data that you want to input into a spreadsheet, Google Sheets is an ok place to start. Google Sheets is also great because you never have to worry about saving your work. If you are online, Google Sheets automatically saves your work. 11.0.1 What is a spreadsheet? A spreadsheet is a type of document where data are stored in rows and columns of a grid. Each square is referred to as a ‘cell’ in the spreadsheet. In Google Sheets (and many other spreadsheet programs like Excel), the rows are numbered (like 1,2,3,…) and the columns are labeled with capital letters (like A, B, C,…). spreadsheet If you want to talk about a specific spot on the grid you can use the number and letter corresponding to that point. For example, A2 specifies the data in cell in the first column (A) and second row (2) of the spreadsheet. spreadsheet position When you are working with data in a spreadsheet you can type directly into the spreadsheet. It is important to make sure you double check all the numbers you type since there isn’t a good way to “spellcheck” your work when you are editing a spreadsheet. We will talk a lot more in future courses about how to organize data that you have collected. Mostly we will want to collect “tidy data” which is data that has Each type of data in one column. Each data point in one row. One spreadsheet for each “kind” of data. If you have more than one spreadsheet, they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linked. Here we are only collecting one “kind” of data - just data on books. The columns will be different types of information about the books. We will collect information on the name of the book, the number of sales of that book, the minimum price of the book, and the suggested price of the book. Each of those will be in a separate column. Then, for each book, we will make a new row with the data for that book. Remember we are collecting information on the bestselling books from the last week on Leanpub. You can find the list of bestsellers here: https://leanpub.com/bookstore. Remember that if you click on the image of one book you will get something that looks like this. Powershell 101 landing page 11.0.2 Setting up your spreadsheet When we collect the information we will use the Google Sheets software to store it for us. You will need to open up another web browser. You can do this by holding down the key ctrl and pressing t. This will open up a new tab. Leave this page open and type go to Google Sheets by navigating to the website https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/ in the new tab. You will see something like this. Google sheets home Now click on the big plus sign and you will get a new spreadsheet that will look like this. Untitled sheet If you click on the words “Untitled Spreadsheet” you can rename the spreadsheet. Type in the words “leanpub_data” to change the name of your spreadsheet. You should now have a spreadsheet that looks like this. leanpub_data sheet We are almost done setting up the spreadsheet, now we just need to label the different kinds of data we are going to collect. Start by clicking on the upper left hand cell (A1) and type “title”. This will be the column where we are going to store information on the title of the book. leanpub_data sheet with title Then move one cell to the right, click and type “readers”. This will be where we will store how many readers a book has. Move one more cell to the right type “suggested” and then one more cell and type “minimum”. Make sure your column names are not capitalized. leanpub_data sheet with headers 11.0.3 Collecting data Now you are all set to start collecting data! To do this open another new tab by holding ctrl and pressing t, then go to the webpage: https://leanpub.com/bookstore. Click on the book and write the title, number of readers, suggested, and minimum prices on a row in the spreadsheet tab. When you are doing this make sure that: There are no commas in numbers. Just leave them out. So don’t write “1,036” write “1036” instead. You don’t put dollar signs for the price, just include the number like “7.99.” If a book’s minimum price is free, enter “0” in the cell. If the book has no readers, put “0” in the cell. If the book’s author opted not to include how many readers their book has, put “NA” in the “readers” column for that book. So for me, since the first book is “PowerShell 101” after getting the data for the first book my spreadsheet will look like this. First row of data for project Continue this process, entering each book into a new row. Collect information on ten or twenty books. One book for every row. At the end you should have a data set that looks something like this. But yours will have different numbers and names in it. First complete data set 11.0.4 Checking your data Now that you’ve entered your data into the Google Sheet, we want to check for a few possible issues before moving on to make sure the data are formatted correctly. Double to make sure the following are true for the data in your spreadsheet: You have at least 11 rows with reader and minimum price information (one header row and at least 10 books included - if you have NAs anywhere, you’ll want more than 11 books) Your dollar amounts do NOT have dollar signs next to them. Your number of readers does not include any commas. If a book’s minimum price is FREE, you have put the number 0 in the cell, rather than “FREE” Checking your data This is great! You now have a question you want to answer and you have collected some data to answer that question. You are on your way to becoming a data scientist! 11.0.5 Publishing to the web Our plan is to use the data in this spreadsheet to answer our question about how the price of a bestselling book relates to how much the author is charging for that book. To do so in the next lesson, you will first have to publish the data to the web. This gives the software we’ll use in the next lesson permission to access your data. to make your sheet public, you’ll want to click on File at the top of the Google Sheet. From the drop-down menu that appears, you’ll want to click on “Publish to the web.” Publish to the web… In the window that pops up, you’ll want to click on “Publish” Publish A box will appear to confirm that you would like to publish this Google Sheet. Click “OK.” OK 11.0.6 Making the sheet public After publishing your data to the web, the last step is to make these data accessible to others who have the link.This can be done easily on a Google Sheet by clicking on “Share” in the top right-hand corner of the Google Sheet. Share A “Share with others” box will pop up. Click on “Get shareable link.” Share with others Your screen will update so that this document can now be viewed by anyone, as long as they have the link to the spreadsheet. Shareable Congrats!! You have successfully made this spreadsheet shareable and the link has been copied. You’ll be asked to paste this link in the quiz for this lesson, and we’ll use this spreadsheet link in the next lesson when you get started using RStudio Cloud, so don’t close your Google Sheets tab quite yet. 11.0.7 Slides and Video Google Sheets Slides "],["rstudio-cloud.html", "Chapter 12 RStudio Cloud", " Chapter 12 RStudio Cloud The main software that we are going to use to analyze data in this class is called R. R is a piece of software that lets you write computer code to analyze data. RStudio is a company that makes a piece of software that works with R. RStudio makes it easier to create, save, share, and work with R code and data sets. R is one of the two most popular languages for data science. We will learn a lot more about it throughout the courses, but here we are just going to use it to take a peak at the data you have created. If you have a more traditional laptop you can download and install R and RStudio on your laptop. But this class is part of our DataTrail program where we will be teaching you how to do everything through a web browser. Fortunately RStudio also offers a web-based version of their software called RStudio Cloud. In a future class we will go into much more detail about RStudio and RStudio Cloud. For now, we will just go over the basics and then use RStudio Cloud to do a very basic analysis of the data you collected in your Google Sheet. Using RStudio Cloud we will give you all the commands you need to run to complete this project. Don’t worry if this seems a little foreign, we are going to learn a lot more about it later! Just follow the steps and you’ll end up with your very first plot! 12.0.1 RStudio Cloud Basics Before we get started with the data you collected, we’ll explain the basic components of RStudio Cloud. There are four main components in an RStudio Cloud window: the scripting area, the Console, the Environment, and the Files directory. We’ll briefly discuss each part now and go into a lot more detail later. Four RStudio Cloud components First, in the top left-hand portion of the window, the scripting area is where you will see code to run in your first project in a few slides. In the future, this will be where you will type all your code. The code typed in this space can be saved and re-run later whenever you need it. Scripting RStudio Cloud In the bottom left-hand portion of the window is the Console. This is where the code you type in the scripting window above will actually run. You script what you want to happen in the scripting window. In the Console, what you wanted to happen actually happens. Console RStudio Cloud The coding language R is an object-oriented programming language. This means that when you code, objects are created. We’ll talk in detail about what that means later. However, any objects that you create while coding will be listed here in the Environment section in the top right-hand portion of the RStudio Cloud window. Environment RStudio Cloud The fourth component is at the bottom on the right-hand side of the window. Here, any files or folders you create, such as the scripts you save, will be listed. Files RStudio Cloud You’ll also note that there are multiple tabs in each of these sections. We’ll talk about the other tabs shortly; however, we’ll note now that in the bottom right-hand section, there is a “Plots” tab. If you were to click on that you would simply see an empty blank space because you haven’t made any plots yet. However, when you do the project you’ll be generating a plot. The plot you create will show up in this tab. Plots RStudio Cloud 12.0.2 Data Science Project in RStudio Cloud Now that you’re a little familiar with RStudio Cloud, we can get started on using the data you collected from Leanpub and entered into your Google Sheet spreadsheet. We’ll then be one step closer to answering the project question “How does the price of a bestselling book relate to how much the author is charging for that book?” To start working in RStudio Cloud, open up a new tab by pressing ctrl and pressing t, then copy this URL and paste it into your web browser http://bit.ly/cbds_projects. If you get a log in page, press the button to “Log in with Google” just like you did when you were setting up your account. You should now see a page that looks like this. You should see a Project listed that is called “leanpub_project”. RStudio Cloud projects home page On the right-hand side, you should see an icon to “Copy” the project. Click on this icon. RStudio Cloud new project You should now see a page that looks like this across the top. RStudio Cloud project page You’ll first want to title your project. Click on ‘leanpub_project’ at the top and begin typing. Title it with ‘leanpub_project_lastname’. So, for example if your last name were Doe, the project would be titled ‘leanpub_project_doe’. You’re ready to get going! RStudio Cloud project named You are now using the RStudio software! The first thing that you should do is go to the bottom right hand side of the screen and click on the file called “leanpub_googlesheets_analysis.R”. RStudio Cloud project R file This should open up a file full of code in the top left-hand portion of the screen. Your screen should now look like this. RStudio Cloud project page with script open This file already has computer code in it. That computer code will read the data from the Google Sheet you have created and make a plot. If you scroll through this code you will see likes that start with “#”. Any time you see a line that starts with a pound sign (#) in code is a comment. This is text that is added to explain to anyone looking at the code what the code does. The rest of the text in this file tells the computer what to do. Using this code, we’ll do a few things: Get things set up. The details aren’t important now, but we’ll definitely get into them later in the series. Read in the Google Sheet you generated. Check to make sure that the data are in the correct format. Make a plot that will look at the relationship between the number of readers and minimum price for Leanpub books. In the future, you’ll learn how to write this code. For now, all the code is available to you. All you should have to do to make this work is copy the public URL for the Google Sheet that you made in the last chapter of the course. To do this, scroll through the code in the top left-hand panel of RStudio Cloud. Find the place in the computer code that says “PASTE_YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_LINK_HERE!”. rstudio.cloud with leanpub_googlesheets_analysis.R with PASTE_YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_LINK_HERE! Delete ‘PASTE_YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_LINK_HERE!’ and paste your URL. One thing to keep in mind is that when you copy the URL from the top of your Google Sheet OR from the blue ‘Share’ button at the top right-hand side of the screen, the link will have a little extra information at the end. After pasting the copied URL into the code, you’ll want to delete the tail-end of the URL starting at ‘/edit’. Below you will see what should be included in the pink box at top or the pink text of the link below. Everything after ‘/edit’ should be deleted. RStudio Cloud with URL edited Your code should look something like this now: RStudio Cloud with leanpub_googlesheets_analysis.R with personal URL Now you should be ready to run your code! You can do so all at once by highlighting all the code in the “leanpub_googlesheets_analysis.R” script. Then, you would find the button that says “Run” at the top of the code file and click on that button. RStudio Cloud run code You should see code running in the bottom left-hand panel. As code runs, there will be some output in red text, letting you know that the code is running. This red text does not mean anything is wrong. Note that red text in RStudio sometimes is an error, while other times it is just providing you with information. If it says error, than it’s an error. But, don’t be alarmed that red text is appearing on your screen. If the code runs, a plot should appear on the lower right hand side. RStudio Cloud with plot If a plot does not show up, there are errors. The first place to check for errors is in your ‘leanpub_googlesheets_analysis.R’ code file. Errors in code formatting in RStudio are marked by a red ‘X’ to the left of any code lines that have errors. For example, if you copy and pasted your Google Slides link but accidentally deleted the second set of quotes before the final parenthesis, a red X would show up, showing you which line has the coding error that needs to be fixed. RStudio Cloud code error in leanpub_googlesheets_analysis.R If you don’t see any red Xs in your code, there is likely an error with how you formatted your spreadsheet. The errors will appear in the bottom left-hand Console panel. Scroll through the text there to see if any of the error messages help point you to what mistake may have been made. Then, edit your spreadsheet in Google Sheets and re-run all the code again. RStudio Cloud after running the code in leanpub_googlesheets_analysis.R Once you have your plot, you have what you need to make the Google Doc and finish your project in the next lesson. Keep this tab open so that you can copy your plot in the next lesson! 12.0.3 Slides and Video RStudio Cloud Slides "],["google-docs.html", "Chapter 13 Google Docs", " Chapter 13 Google Docs Like Google Sheets, Google Docs is an online and free program, but instead of being used to create and edit spreadsheets, Google Docs is a place where you can create and edit word documents. Google Docs is similar to Microsoft Word, for those who are familiar. For those who aren’t, Google Docs is somewhere you can type notes or any type of text. Like Google Sheets, Google Docs will automatically save your work anytime you are connected to the Internet. 13.0.1 Getting started in Google Docs To begin, you’ll open a new tab by typing ctrl and t at the same time. In the web address bar you’ll go to ‘www.docs.google.com’. This will bring you to the homepage for Google Docs. To get started with a blank document you’ll click on the ‘Blank’ document at the left top of the screen. Google Docs Home This will open a Blank Google Doc. You’re now ready to get started working in Google Docs. Blank Google Doc 13.0.2 Using Google Docs You could just start typing in the document; however, for your Leanpub data science project, you’ll want to first change the name of the document. To do so, click at the top of the document where it says ‘Untitled document’ and type leanpub_project_lastname. So if your last name were Doe, the title of this document would be ‘leanpub_project_doe.’ Google Doc named project In this document, you’ll want to include a short summary about what question you were asking, what data you collected, and where these data were collected from in a section titled “Summary”. You’ll then want to paste your results and explain what you see in the plot you generated in a “Results” section. Finally you’ll conclude how the price of a bestselling book relates to how much the author is charging for that book in a “Conclusion” section. Google Doc Report sample In order to get the plot to paste into your report, you’ll start a new tab by typing ctrl and t at the same time and going to http://bit.ly/cbds_projects. You should see your project here. You will click on that project. The analysis you already carried out will be here. To copy the plot you generated, click on ‘Export’ in the ‘Plots’ tab in the bottom right-hand of the RStudio window. Export in rstudio.cloud Then, click on ‘Copy to Clipboard.’ Copy to Clipboard Your plot will pop up in a new window. Plot in rstudio.cloud With your cursor over the plot that pops up, you will then tap the mouse keypad with two fingers at the same time to bring up a new menu. On this menu, select, ‘Copy Image.’ Copy image in rstudio.cloud You can now return to Google Docs, place your cursor where you’d like the plot to go, tap the mouse keypad with two fingers at the same time to bring up a new menu, and click ‘Paste’ to paste your plot from RStudio Cloud in your Google Doc. Paste in Google Docs Your plot will now be in your Google Doc! Plot in Google Doc 13.0.3 Sharing Your Google Doc Google Docs are helpful to data scientists because they will not only allow you to keep notes about what you have done and what you have found from your analyses, but they will allow you to share this information with people you work with, which is critically important to data scientists. So, the last thing we’ll do is get the link so that you can share this document with others. You will paste this link in the quiz at the end of this section. To get this link, you’ll click on the blue ‘Share’ button on the top right-hand section of the Google Doc. Share Google Doc A ‘Share with others’ box will pop up in the middle of the screen. Click on ‘Get shareable link.’ Shareable Link A new screen will pop up informing you that your link has been copied. This is the link you will paste by pressing ctrl and v in the quiz below when asked for your Google Doc link. Congrats! You’ve completed your first report from a data science project! 13.0.4 Slides and Video Google Docs Slides "],["google-slides.html", "Chapter 14 Google Slides", " Chapter 14 Google Slides Google Slides is the last Google product we will discuss today. It is a place to make free, online presentations. Similar to Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides allows users like you to create presentations to communicate findings from a project to a general audience. However, unlike PowerPoint, fortunately your work is saved automatically whenever you are online, and it’s free! As a data scientist, you are frequently required to present your findings. Sometimes that is in the form of a report, such as the Google Doc you made in the last section. However, very often, you are required to make a slide presentation. Here, we will discuss what a slide presentation is and some features of a good slide presentation before you make a brief presentation about your Leanpub data science project. Slide presentations are often used to present to a group of people. You as the analyst would be explaining what is on the slides out loud and using what is on the slides to support what you are saying. This means that every detail of the analysis does not have to be on the slide. You can use what you say out loud to fill in the details. 14.0.1 What is a slide presentation? A slide presentation is a presentation that consists of multiple slides. Each slide is there to get a smaller message across so that when all the slides are viewed in order, they tell a story. As data scientists, the story we are most often telling is the story of an analysis. This typically starts with a question, then explains the data collected to answer the question, followed by an explanation of the analysis, and concludes with the results and conclusions drawn from the analysis. Each part of this story will typically have at least one slide to explain that part of the analysis. Here we will discuss how to get started in Google Slides and then make a short presentation. 14.0.2 Presentation Guidelines We’ll go into more details later, but there are three things to keep in mind anytime you are making a slide presentation: 1. Pictures are often better than words. 2. Minimize the number of words on each slide. 3. Make the font and pictures big enough to be seen when presentation is projected. 14.0.3 Getting started in Google Slides To get started, open a new tab in your browser by holding down ctrl and t at the same time and going to ‘slides.google.com’. This will bring you to the Google Slides home page. To start a new presentation, click on the “Blank” presentation at left. Google Slides Home This will open up a blank and simple slide where you can begin to work on your presentation. Google Slides Blank presentation Similar to the Google Doc you created, you’ll want to rename this file. To do so, click on ‘Untitled presentation’ in the top left-hand corner of the presentation. Again, title this slideshow using your last name. For example, if your last name were Doe, you would title this ‘leanpub_presentation_doe.’ You’re now ready to get ready working on your first slide! Google Slides rename file 14.0.4 Making a simple presentation Keeping the presentation guidelines we discussed earlier in mind, you’ll now start to make a short (approximately 4 slides) Google Slides presentation. To begin, you’ll want a title slide. To change the title, click on the slide where it says ‘Click to add title’ and then begin to type the title of your slide presentation. Google Slides Blank slide A reasonable title would be ‘Leanpub Data Science Project.’ You’d then want to include who did the analysis as a subtitle. By clicking ‘Click to add subtitle’ you can then include your name on your presentation. Google slide with title and name If you wanted to change the font size of any of the text to make it bigger or smaller, you would highlight that text and then click on the font size at the top of the menu to display a drop down menu. Font size can be selected from this list or typed in that box directly. Change font size on Google Slides You can use a similar process of highlighting text and then selecting from the toolbar to change formatting in a number of other ways. You can change the font of the text, make the text bold, italicize the text, underline the text, or change the color of the text as well. other formatting options on slides Once you’re happy with how your title slide looks, you’ll want to start working on the next slide in your presentation. To start the next slide, you’ll click the plus sign at the top left-hand portion of your Google Slides presentation. Google Slides new slide A second slide in your presentation will appear. You can add text to this slide the same way you did on the title slide. Pictures can also be copy and pasted into your Google Slides. Google Slides second slide You will want to create a Google Slides presentation with approximately four slides summarizing the Leanpub data science project you have been working on. These slides should include * Title slide * The question you were asking in your data science project * Information about how the data were collected, where the data came from, and what data were collected * The results (including your plot!) and conclusions from your analysis 14.0.5 Sharing your Google Slides Presentation Once you’ve finished creating your Google Slides presentation, you’ll want to make sure it can be shared with others. This will be the same process as in Google Sheets and Google Docs. To make the presentation shareable, you will first click the Blue ‘Share’ button at the top right-hand side of the slide. Google Slides share A ‘Share with others’ window will pop up. Here you will click ‘Get shareable link’. This will bring up a new box indicating that your link has been copied. This is the link you will paste when asked by the quiz at the end of this lesson for your Google slides link.
